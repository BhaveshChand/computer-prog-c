 Q1.            Write a program to print the following series and also find out the sum of series.

                                          1 + 22 + 333 + 4444 +.................. + N terms

Q2. Rewrite the program written as PROGRAM 1 using only do-while loops; and as PROGRAM 2 using only for loop. First implement  the given programs and see their respective output. Then, rewrite them and see whether you get the same output or not.

PROGRAM 1:

                int main (void){
                             int num;
                             printf ("Enter a positive integer");
                             scanf ("%d",&num);
                             do {
                                          printf ("%d  ",num%10);
                                          num /= 10;
                                   } while (num > 0);
                                      return (0);
                            }
 

PROGRAM 2

                        int main(void)
                        {
                          int i, j;
                          for(i=0;i<10; ++i)
                               for(j=1; j<40; j++)
                                        printf(“%d %d \t”, i,j);
                          return (0);
                        }
